# Py4Research
My solutions for HarvardX &amp; EdX.org's 'Using Python for Research' course material.

## Week 1
Python basics; Skipped in this record, but easy enough even if you've just learned python 3 like I had.
>"Exercises for homework (Week 1). In this homework, we will use objects, functions, and randomness to find the length of documents, approximate pi, and smooth out random noise."

## [Week 2](./Week2.py)
Libraries and python research concepts; This is where I will start to save some of my homework assignments.
>"Exercises for Homework (Week 2). Tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses) is a simple strategy game in which two players take turns placing a mark on a 3x3 board, attempting to make a row, column, or diagonal of three with their mark. In this homework, we will use the tools we've covered in the past two weeks to create a tic-tac-toe simulator and evaluate basic winning strategies."

## Week 3
### [DNA Translation](./dna_translation.py)
Code created following course notes. It takes a txt file containing a dna sequence from the NCBI and uses a table to translate it to proteins. Then it takes the NCBI protein txt and compares it to your result. Prints the translated protein if its correct.
### [Case Study 1](./case_study_1.py) 
Woo cyrptography, starting with the basics. Et tu Brute?
>"Over the next five exercises, we will create our own Caesar cipher, as well as a message decoder for this cipher. In this exercise, we will define the alphabet used in the cipher."
### [Language Processing](./lang_proc_plot.py)
Code created following course notes. Takes given books file from the Gutenberg Project in 4 languages and reads them all. Counts unique words and amount of words. Then plots them respective to language using matplotlib.pyplot
### [Case Study 2](./case_study_2.py) Translations of Hamlet
Use knowledge from previous exersizes to analyze one specific literary work in multiple translations and plot data.
>"In this case study, we will find and visualize summary statistics of the text of different translations of Hamlet"
