# Py4Research
My solutions for HarvardX &amp; EdX.org's 'Using Python for Research' course material.

# Week 1
Python basics; Skipped in this record but easy enough even if you've just learned python 3 like I had.

# Week 2
Libraries and python research concepts; This is where I will start to save soem of my homework assignments.
