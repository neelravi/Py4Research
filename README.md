# Py4Research
My solutions for HarvardX &amp; EdX.org's 'Using Python for Research' course material.

## Week 1
Python basics; Skipped in this record, but easy enough even if you've just learned python 3 like I had.
>"Exercises for homework (Week 1). In this homework, we will use objects, functions, and randomness to find the length of documents, approximate pi, and smooth out random noise."

## Week 2
Libraries and python research concepts; This is where I will start to save some of my homework assignments.
>"Exercises for Homework (Week 2). Tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses) is a simple strategy game in which two players take turns placing a mark on a 3x3 board, attempting to make a row, column, or diagonal of three with their mark. In this homework, we will use the tools we've covered in the past two weeks to create a tic-tac-toe simulator and evaluate basic winning strategies."
